# How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business

# Session 1
## Chapter 1
* What I perceive as hard to measure/quantify:
  * *"How to measure value of core values of an Organisation"*
  * *"How to measure expected happiness moving to a a new neighbourhood"*
* Care about a given measurement as it informs a decision
  * measurement is supporting decision
* Method to analyse options to reduce uncertainty when taking decisions
* AIE - Applied Information Economics

* Its about reducing uncertainty, any delta is useful as the decision will be more informed and less uncertain.
* We don't need to be perfect

## Chapter 2
* Fermi
  * Fermi questions
    * to set delta 0 - understand our current understanding of something as a precursor to further measurement
  * confetti + blast radius
* Eratosthenes -> circumference
* small observations combined with facts gave answers to big questions
* Emily's more basic question "the ability to feel energy field" instead of measuring patient's health
  * simplified experiment extremely

## Chapter 3
* Misconceptions
  * Concept of measurement - measurement definitions misunderstood
  * Object of measurement - not well defined enough
  * Method of measurement - many procedures of empirical observations not well known

* "If we incorrectly think that measurement means meeting some nearly
  unachievable standard of certainty, then few things will be
  measurable even in the physical sciences"
* Definition of Measurement, Information Theory version - "A
  quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or
  more observations."
* Stanley Smith Stevens, on the theory of scales and measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
  * i.e it doesn't have to always be ratio scale, nominal set membership statements still is a measurement.
* Clarification Chain
  1. if it matters at all, it is detectable/observable.
  2. If it is detectable, it can be detected as an amount (or range of possible amounts)
  3. If it can be detected as a range of possible amounts, it can be measured
* Rule of five: There is a 93.75% chance that the median of a population is between the smallest and largest values in any random sample of five from the that population
  * chance of getting heads five times in a row = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/32 = 3.125%. The chance of not getting all heads or tails is then 100% - 3.125% * 2 or 93.75%.
* The urn of Mystery (The single sample Majority Rule)
* "If you don't know what to measure, measure it anyway. You'll learn what to measure" - David Moore
* "In most business cases, most of the variables have an 'information value' at or near zero. But usually at least some variables have an information value that is so high that some deliberate measurement effort is easily justified"
* Gaming measurement - School that dropped low-achieving students
* Measuring what we know to measure isn't what we should be measuring - not measuring what matters most
* Four useful measurement assumptions
  1. It's been measured before
    * Your situation isn't as unique as you think
  2. You have far more data than you think.
    * Indirect information, think Eratosthenes
  3. You need far less data than you think.
    * when you know almost nothing, almost anything will tell you something
  4. Useful, new observations are more accessible than you think
    * Measuring Orchestra performance - simple measurement of measuring number of standing ovations
* Think of measurement as iterative. Experiment, makes an attempt, MVP in product thinking?
