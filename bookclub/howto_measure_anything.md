# How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business

# Session 1
## Chapter 1
* What I perceive as hard to measure/quantify:
  * *"How to measure value of core values of an Organisation"*
  * *"How to measure expected happiness moving to a a new neighbourhood"*
* Care about a given measurement as it informs a decision
  * measurement is supporting decision
* Method to analyse options to reduce uncertainty when taking decisions

* Its about reducing uncertainty, any delta is useful as the decision will be more informed and less uncertain.
* We don't need to be perfect

## Chapter 2
* Fermi
  * Fermi questions
    * to set delta 0 - understand our current understanding of something as a precursor to further measurement
  * confetti + blast radius
* Eratosthenes -> circumference
* small observations combined with facts gave answers to big questions
* Emily's more basic question "the ability to feel energy field" instead of measuring patient's health
  * simplified experiment extremely
